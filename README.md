# delphitranslate
Educational example of using WebStencils and AI to emulate popular public web-based translation tools


## Opening and compiling the app

1. You will need a recent copy of RAD Studio or Delphi. You can download a trial or the free CE version here: [www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi)

2. To open and use the Amazon AWS Translate service you will need to install the Appercept AWS SDK **before you can run the project**. 
   
   If you have a recent version of RAD Studio Enterprise or Architect you install the Embarcadero version using the GetIt package manager - by typing in "AWS" in the search box.
   
   Or you can get the full professional Appercept AWS SDK package directly from Appercept [www.appercept.com](https://www.appercept.com)

## This app accompanies a webinar
I wrote this for an episode of our Embarcadero AI Code Camp series.  You can catch the webinar replay via the link below.

The video shows the app in use and explains how I did it.
